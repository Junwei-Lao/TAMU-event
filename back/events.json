Noon–6 p.m; Closed Mon.Comprised of lithographs, woodcuts and etchings, this exhibition brings together powerful works that reflect the vital role artists played—and continue to play—in shaping the public consciousness of war and memory. These prints serve as both documentary records and poetic interpretations, capturing not only the devastation and resilience of people and places but also the emotional landscape of a world transformed by conflict.Drawing on Francis Brennan’s 1942 call that the American people needed their artists “to charge them with the grave responsibility of spelling out their anger, their grief, their greatness and their justice,” the exhibition honors those who responded through the enduring medium of printmaking—bearing witness, telling stories that history books cannot and offering deeply personal visions of collective experience.",

This exhibition celebrates their generosity and, we hope, will inspire others to share their treasures with the University.

Notices are posted at the Memorial Student Center, Evans Library, and at the base of the flagpole in front of the Academic Building. At 10:15 p.m., chimes from the Albritton Bell Tower begin to play. The ceremony begins at 10:30 p.m. as the Ross Volunteers Firing Squad marches in slow cadence to the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross. Three volleys are fired. “Silver Taps” is played by six buglers three times – to the North, West, and South. This concludes the ceremony, but not the feelings of respect and honor.With respect, the ceremony of Silver Taps is dedicated to the deceased Aggie and is a solemn and serious event. Some important observances must be remembered:The area in front of the Sul Ross statue and the Academic Building is reserved for the friends and family of the deceased.Aggies do not stand or sit on the benches lining the walkway between the flagpole and the Sul Ross Statue.The darkness and quiet, which cover the campus, emphasize the mood for Silver Taps. Aggies help to retain this tranquility by covering windows, keeping noise to a minimum, and walking to and from the ceremony without talking.The name of the deceased Aggie is posted on the flagpole base during the day of Silver Taps.",

Negroponte, who will speak about President George H.W. Bush’s vision for free trade across the Americas and establishment of the North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA).RSVPThis event is highly relevant today as debates over free trade, regional integration, and global competition continue to shape U.S. economic policy. Ambassador (ret.) John Negroponte’s reflections on President George H.W. Bush’s vision for the North American Free Trade Agreement provide valuable historical context for current discussions about supply chains, economic resilience, and international partnerships. For Texas A&M students, the talk offers an opportunity to connect theory with practice, learn from a distinguished diplomat, and better understand how trade policy influences both global dynamics and local economic opportunities in Texas.Negroponte has served as Ambassador to Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines, the United Nations, and Iraq. He served twice on the National Security Council staff, first as Director for Vietnam in the Nixon Administration and then as Deputy National Security Advisor under President Reagan. He has also held a cabinet level position as the first Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush. His most recent position in government was as Deputy Secretary of State, where he served as the State Department’s Chief Operating Officer.The ConocoPhillips White House Lecture Series is sponsored by ConocoPhillips of Houston, Texas, whose 2002 endowment to the George and Barbara Bush Foundation established the program. The Lecture Series brings to public attention the various offices of the White House and Executive Branch that provide policy, administrative, and overall support to the President. The purpose is to bring to life the workings of the White House, a better understanding of the governmental process, and an opportunity to examine and understand the particular function and challenges of each office. In this manner, the series provides a more comprehensive picture of the Presidency and the people around the President.",

    "event_summary": "University structure/governance varies little across the world and has changed little in basic form across time. It is, at its essence, deeply colonial and Western, characterized by a hierarchical distribution of power. However, as the world changes rapidly around us, there is a growing need to authentically include the diverse voices of stakeholders (i.e., staff and students) in the decisions that affect their work, learning, and wellbeing. This course presents a shared governance model, “Sociocracy”, that stresses inclusion and deliberate attention to power dynamics. Based on consent and not consensus, sociocracy operates at scales from small groups to entire organizations. Participants will explore connections among governance/decision-making, power structures, and participatory equity in higher education. They will explore sociocracy as a model for fostering shared decision-making in classrooms, committees, departments, and other academic spaces, and generate actionable plans to improve power dynamics and advance equity and inclusion in their own contexts. By the end of this course, participants will be able to:Identify relationships, power structures, and/or gaps in participatory equity in governance at their home institution.Define, explain, and justify the use of Sociocracy as a viable governance model at multiple levels or scales.Explain the significance of sociocratic structures and processes.Design sociocratic structures at levels or scales relevant to their local contexts.The course will also prepare participants to apply practical strategies that foster more equitable, inclusive, and participatory forms of leadership. These approaches are adaptable to a wide range of settings and contexts. Participants will learn how to:Structure and facilitate meetings effectively.Engage students as active partners in course design and learning.Incorporate regular feedback loops to improve processes, strengthen decision-making, and enhance collaborative projects.",

Why does Florida swing during presidential elections?” Contrary to popular assumptions about Florida voting patterns, Florida’s Latino vote is not determined by a monolithic voting-bloc. Rather, multiple generations of immigrants from across the Caribbean and the Americas— all of whom have conflicting politics, migration motivations, and concepts of self— shape, and have long shaped, election outcomes in the state. As Florida becomes a testing ground for national policies, understanding the history that created the state becomes increasingly essential. In this presentation, I will introduce her project as well as community engaged work that amplifies connections between scholarship and public application of research.MitraIn 2020,Timemagazine named Bilkis Bano, an octogenarian protestor from Delhi, among the 100 most influential people in the world, referring to her as “the dadi from Shaheen Bagh.” The Shaheen Bagh movement (2019–2020) became a landmark in Indian anti-fascist resistance, as elderly Muslim women led mass protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), which sought to disenfranchise undocumented minorities. This paper examines Bilkis’ 2020 interview onNews 18 Urdu, highlighting how the affectionate and intimate figure of thedadi(grandmother) reconfigures assumptions about political agency, gender, and age. I argue that the centrality of elderly Muslim women in Shaheen Bagh illuminates the affective politics of belonging, citizenship, and intergenerational resistance in contemporary India.Chair: Rick Pulos | Communication & JournalismPlease note that this is not a lecture, and thus, is not suited for class attendance.

    "event_description": "Presenters:Ilayda Onder, Assistant Professor | Political Science“Performative Rebel Governance and Legibility: Evidence from Southeast Turkey”Noah Crawford, Ph.D. Student | History“‘Humanity’s Cause’: The International Dimensions of the American Civil War Refugee Crisis”Abstracts:OnderRebel groups often engage in performative governance acts that mimic the symbolic repertoires of sovereign states (e.g., printing currency, holding funeral rites, or building mausoleums). How do these acts shape rebel-constituency ties? I conceptualize performative rebel governance as a legibility-oriented strategy for identifying loyal civilians in harder-to-reach communities—those beyond the rebels’ immediate networks. Yet, these same acts also increase the legibility of rebellion to the state, exposing pro-rebel civilians to surveillance and paradoxically trading off the ability to expand rebels’ mobilization base beyond their traditional networks for an overall decline in mobilization. I provide evidence for this theory using original spatial event data on the funeral rites of PKK fighters in Southeast Turkey with microdata on PKK recruitment. The findings show that while funeral rites increase the recruitment of women and individuals with no history of political activism or family ties to the rebel movement, overall recruitment declines. These results reveal an inherent dilemma in rebel governance in contested spaces: while governance helps insurgents overcome informational deficiencies by eliciting civilian agency to reveal allegiances, it simultaneously renders the social landscape of war more legible to the government side of the conflict.CrawfordAs Union and Confederate armies battled to the east, the Texas-Mexico border region along the Rio Grande became a hotspot for refugee activity as pro-Union Texans fled to Mexico—a fellow republican state—that had already abolished slavery. By 1863, northern Mexico was embroiled in a civil war of its own as imperial France tried to install a European-style state on Mexico. Unionists in Mexico were surprised to find solidarity with Liberal Republican Mexican forces and even joined forces to combat Confederate Texans and French soldiers alike. The principles of transnational republicanism drew the United States and the Republic of Mexico together during the 1860s and reinforced the principles of an abolitionist ballad that encouraged its listeners to heed “humanity’s call.” This paper contextualizes the American Civil War’s refugee crisis as part of a larger nineteenth century Atlantic world that blended liberation ideology with republican principles.Chair: Seulgiye Kim | EnglishPlease note that this is not a lecture, and thus, is not suited for class attendance.

    "event_description": "This gathering brings together a select group of scholars whose work engages Hurston’s understudied contributions to legal culture, race-making, and spatial justice in rural, carceral, and colonial contexts across the African Diaspora. Drawing on Hurston’s fiction, plays, folklore collections, journalism, and anthropological fieldwork between 1927 and 1953, this symposium will critically examine how African-descended communities understood, challenged, and navigated legal systems and law-adjacent themes beyond the reach of formal courts and civil rights jurisprudence.",

    "event_description": "Presenters:Stephen Riegg, Associate Professor | History“Imperial Hopes and Evangelical Disappointment: Scottish and Swiss Missions in Tsarist Russia’s Caucasus”Lauren Nyquist, Ph.D. Student | GeographyAbstracts:RieggThis paper is a draft of the “Introduction” to my in-progress book manuscript. The project addresses how Russian officials at the turn of the nineteenth century faced a colonial problem that they realized required innovation: the long-coveted Caucasus region could not be annexed through the traditional use of Cossack cavalry and Slavic settlers alone. For help, they turned to Western Europe. My book shows how and why tsarist officials “outsourced” certain tasks of empire building. Romanov imperialists improvised a trial-and-error program of tolerating the settlement of Scottish missionaries, French silk barons, German schismatics, and Swiss evangelicals in these strategically vital borderlands. With both alacrity and apprehension, the Russian state hoped to secure the sociopolitical stability and economic vitality of its Caucasus dominion through the collaboration of foreign expatriates.NyquistMore information forthcoming.Chair: Zachary Stewart | ArchitecturePlease note that this is not a lecture, and thus, is not suited for class attendance. The Colloquium Series is intended to provide the presenter with a forum to discuss their research and receive feedback from colleagues and peers.",

He will focus on (relatively) recent evidence about the degree to which there is variation in teacher effectiveness associated with where teachers received their credentials and the effectiveness of the teacher who served as the cooperating teacher during student achievement. And he will present new evidence on the factors predicting whether college students progress through the early teacher pipeline.Bio:Dr. Dan Goldhaber is the Director of the Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER,caldercenter.org) at the American Institutes for Research and the Director of the Center for Education Data & Research (CEDR) at the University of Washington. Both CALDER and CEDR are focused on using state administrative data to do research that informs decisions about policy and practice.Dan’s work focuses on issues of educational productivity and reform at the K-12 level, the broad array of human capital policies that influence the composition, distribution, and quality of teachers in the workforce, and connections between students’ K-12 experiences and  post-secondary outcomes. Topics of published work in this area include studies of the stability of value-added measures of teachers, the effects of teacher qualifications and quality on student achievement, and the impact of teacher pay structure and licensure on the teacher labor market.",

    "event_description": "AbstractThe development of hypersonic vehicles is of broad international interest today for applications in national security, deep space exploration, and the emerging space economy. While the first hypersonic vehicle flew more than 70 years ago, their effective design still faces major technical challenges. The overarching cause of this difficulty stems from the fact that many key individual physical processes relevant to hypersonic flight are tightly coupled. Thegas dynamicsof the air flow around the vehicle creates temperatures of thousands of degrees leading to internal energy excitation and chemical reactions. The hot, oxidized gas in contact with the surfaces of the vehicle leads tomaterial responsephenomena such as conduction, radiation, and ablation. The thermally soaked material alters thestructural responseto the aerodynamic loading. Changes in the vehicle outer mold line due to ablation and structural deformation change the basic aerodynamic performance and thus affect theflight dynamics. With advanced numerical algorithms and modern computer architectures, it is becoming possible to include many of these complex processes in hypersonic vehicle analyses. This talk will review the current status for computational modeling of each separate discipline as well as efforts to couple these processes together. Key aspects for coupling include consideration of timescales associated with different processes and multi-fidelity simulation approaches.BIOIain D. Boyd is the H. T.

Guided by these diagnostics, three computationally tractable approaches are evaluated: (i) rectangular-form NR with an optimal multiplier, (ii) voltage-dependent load switching from constant-power to constant-current/impedance below thresholds, and (iii) a lightweight pre-solve heuristic that adjusts initial voltages at buses implicated by extreme initial branch-flow mismatches.

    "event_description": "Wang Abstract:As power systems become increasingly dominated by renewable resources interfaced through power electronic inverters, achieving stable and flexible grid synchronization is a critical challenge. Conventional Grid-Forming (GFM) and Grid-Following (GFL) inverters offer complementary capabilities, but are typically treated as separate paradigms, making seamless transitions between modes difficult. This talk presents a hybrid GFM–GFL control framework based on Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC), which integrates both power-synchronization and droop-synchronization mechanisms within the Andronov–Hopf nonlinear oscillator. The proposed approach enables multi-mode operation: the inverter can function as either Frequency-Forming or Frequency-Following, and as either Voltage-Forming or Voltage-Following. By adjusting the strength of grid feedback signals, smooth and continuous transitions trajectories between these operating modes are achieved. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through simulations, highlighting seamless on-grid transitions and robust performance in islanded operation.Wang Biography:Xiaoyang Wang is a second-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University, working with Dr. Xin Chen in the Smart Power, Energy, and Decision-making (SPEED) Lab.

Because these systems are traditionally modeled under different assumptions, integrated analysis is both challenging and computationally demanding. This paper compares two power flow methods—back-and-forth co-simulation and direct full-system modeling—on both a small test system and the 150-bus Travis County synthetic grid. Results show that the back-and-forth approach achieves fewer iterations and shorter runtimes for complex systems, with little to no difference in final voltage profiles.Szymanowski Biography:Bart Szymanowski received his bachelor’s degrees in applied mathematics and physics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2023.

The goal is to find a scheduling policy that minimizes a holding-and-abandonment cost during the transient period in which the system is considered congested. Because computing an exact solution to the optimal-control problem is infeasible, we develop a unified asymptotic approximation that covers, in particular, the conventional and the many-server heavy-traffic regimes. In addition to the generality and flexibility of our unified asymptotic framework, we also prove a strong form of asymptotic optimality, under which the costs converge in expectation and in probability.

    "event_description": "Abstract:In big data settings, identifying critical data and variables—essential for efficient computation, robust estimation, and explainable AI—is often like finding needles in a haystack. This talk explores how to locate such “needles” in stochastic simulation for estimating rare-event probabilities and in digital twin calibration, a problem of both theoretical and practical importance. Rare events typically occur under specific input conditions. Yet as dimensionality increases, the search space expands exponentially while the regions driving rare events occupy an increasingly sparse fraction of the overall volume. This phenomenon makes the design of efficient sampling strategies particularly challenging. We address this challenge using two variance reduction techniques: stratified sampling and importance sampling. For stratified sampling, we derive the optimal stratification structure for univariate settings and extend it via decision trees to develop a robust algorithm for multi-dimensional problems. For importance sampling, we propose a novel dimension-reduction method tailored to stochastic simulation. This approach balances concentrating on key variables with broader exploration, thereby reducing variance and improving estimator robustness. Finally, we discuss extensions to digital twin calibration, where massive datasets, high-dimensional parameters, and block-structured data introduce additional computational challenges.Bio:Dr. Eunshin Byon is a Professor and Richard Wilson Scholar in the Industrial and Operations Engineering Department at the University of Michigan, where she also serves as Director of the IOE Master’s Program.

    "event_description": "Abstract:Monolayer and few-layer semiconducting Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs), exemplified by materials like MoS2 and WSe2, have garnered increasing interest for next generation electronics such as gate-all-around nanosheet transistors, neuromorphic devices and sensors/imagers heterogeneously integrated with silicon CMOS technology.The interest in semiconducting TMDs arises from their atomically thin nature and passivated van der Waals surfaces, however, realization of high-performance devices requires advances in TMD synthesis to provide wafer-scale films that can be readily integrated into devices via either direct growth or layer transfer methods.Our work has focused on the development of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) as a manufacturing- compatible approach for wafer-scale semiconducting TMDs. The TMDs are grown epitaxially on 2” diameter c-plane sapphire by MOCVD at elevated temperatures (>800 °C) to obtain high crystal quality. Nucleation of TMDs on sapphire is intimately tied to the surface structure and the growth chemistry which can be controlled to achieve unidirectional TMD domains with a significant reduction in mirror twin domains in coalesced films.In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry is demonstrated to be an effective real time monitor of TMD growth even at the sub-monolayer level which can be exploited to track surface coverage as a function of time under varying growth conditions. The ability to precisely control and modulate precursor flux during growth is used to synthesize in-plane heterostructures that enable localized exciton confinement and emission.Applications for wafer-scale TMD monolayers in nanoelectronics, sensing and photonics will be discussed.Bio:Joan Redwing is a Distinguished Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Penn State University. She currently serves as Director of the 2D Crystal Consortium, an NSF Materials Innovation Platform (MIP) national user facility that is focused on the synthesis and characterization of 2D materials for next generation devices.Her research focuses on crystal growth and epitaxy of electronic materials, with an emphasis on thin film and nanomaterial synthesis by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.She currently serves as Vice President of the American Association for Crystal Growth and the International Organization for Crystal Growth.She is a fellow of the Materials Research Society, the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.She is an author on over 350 publications in refereed journals and holds 8 U.S. patents.",

    "event_description": "Abstract:Similar and dissimilar joining of shape memory alloys (SMAs) has gained increased attention in recent years, due to their use in aerospace, transportation, and biomedical industries. However, traditional joining methods (e.g., fusion welding) are challenging to apply to these materials because they lead to local weakening, formation of brittle intermetallic, and decreases in functional performance.Here, transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding is studied as a viable solution. TLP involves heating a joint to a temperature where interdiffusion produces a lower melting point liquid, which subsequently undergoes isothermal solidification to form a dense joint. TLP is currently used in aerospace for joining similar materials but has proved challenging to extend to dissimilar joining. In this talk, we will discuss how limitations in TLP can be overcome using CALPHAD-based techniques and path planning algorithms to guide phase evolution.We will also describe our ongoing experimental work on similar & dissimilar joints, which include microstructural and mechanical characterization. Although our use case is specific NASA, Houston, Texas to joining SMAs, these approaches are broadly applicable to any dissimilar joining process.Bio:McCue is a tenure-track Assistant Professor and the Morris E. Fine Junior Professor in Materials and Manufacturing at Northwestern University in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.His research group focuses on designing materials for extreme applications – such as aerodynamic, radiation, and corrosion – and understanding how their microstructures evolve in these environments.He received his PhD degree in Materials Science and Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2015 and then held a postdoctoral appointment at Texas A&M University. Prior to joining Northwestern University, he was a Senior Scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, working in the Research and Exploratory Development Department.He received a NASA Early Career Faculty Award in 2021 to develop a thermodynamic framework to guide the design of dissimilar bonding for shape memory alloys, and a DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2023 to develop a new high-strain rate mechanical test method.",

Further, the degenerate set of 4f electrons confers unique, atomistic electronic- and magnetic-properties to complexes of the elements. In recent years, my research group has been working to expand the capabilities of lanthanide elements through fundamental studies of such complexes and their electronic structures. We have demonstrated that studies of cerium complexes, in terms of electronic structure, properties, and reactivity, are fruitful for discovery of both fundamental aspects of f-element chemistry and new reactivity modalities based on 4f-orbital participation. Recent results will be presented on our studies of organometallic complexes of cerium(IV) and related tetravalent metals showing unique participation of 4f-orbitals in bonding and reactivity, detected by monitoring an unusual single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. We have posited that 4f-orbital engagement can also alter reactivity of lanthanide complexes with properly designed ligand frameworks and reaction manifolds through excited states. Our efforts toward these goals, for the purposes of selective, inter-rare earth reactive separations, will also be discussed.",

First, a chemoenzymatic synthesis of 13-oxoverruculogen, an anticancer endoperoxide, is achieved using enzymatic C-H peroxidation and transition metal catalyzed C-C bond activation reactions. Central to the synthesis involves the use of a substrate analog for enzymatic endoperoxidation to accomplish the synthesis of 13-oxoverruculogen. The second part of this presentation describes the chemical synthesis of ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Enteropeptin A is an antimicrobial RiPP natural product with undefined stereochemical configuration at its thioaminoketal stereocenter. The total synthesis of this compound and its congeners resulted in their structural elucidation and the determination of the stereochemical configuration of the enteropeptins.",

It relies on the large mass difference between electrons and nuclei, with nuclei moving much slower and appearing effectively frozen on the time scale of electronic fluctuations. Nevertheless, the BO approximation frequently breaks down, quite famously in photochemistry and/or electron transfer. Less well known is that even when a classical BO theory does not conserve momentum (linear or angular) even when no obvious breakdown occurs. In this talk, I will discuss this failure, introduce phase space approximations as a means to restore conservation, and propose a new paradigm for understanding how nuclear entanglement with electronic degrees of freedom may lead to chiral induced spin selectivity and other magnetic field effects.",

Structural consequences of making these SF5-based “hybrid bioisosteres” and preliminary mechanistic insight will be discussed.

So far, the limited photostability of individual perovskite QDs remains a challenge for their use in quantum light sources, despite improvements in increasing the binding strength of surface ligands. Here, we show that crystallized, solid-state ligands with strong intermolecular interactions can achieve near-epitaxial passivation and greatly reduce the surface energy of perovskite QDs. Individual CsPbBr3 QDs embedded in molecular crystals demonstrate nearly non-blinking single-photon emission with a purity of 98%. Moreover, these QDs stay stable after 12 hours of continuous operation and continue to show almost non-blinking behavior under saturated excitation levels. The remarkable stability of individual QDs, combined with precise control during synthesis, allows for detailed studies of their structural and optical properties.",

I will highlight the development of a novel radical-triggered annulative alkene transposition cascade that enables the modular preparation of valuable spirocyclic ethers from simple starting materials. In the second part, I will discuss our synthetic strategy toward the highly oxidized and bioactive meroterpenoid natural product, talaromyolide D. Our approach leverages efficient C–H disconnection logic to elaborate the polycyclic core of the target, along with several highly diastereoselective transformations, including an electrocatalytic sp²–sp³ cross-coupling.",

Our proof relies on the theory of total linear stability for Dynkin quivers. We also explore several notable combinatorial properties of these triangulations that relate the Bruhat order, the noncrossing partition lattice, and Cambrian congruences. Each triangulation gives an explicit mechanism for relating two different presentations of the corresponding braid group (the standard Artin presentation and Bessis’s dual presentation).

Kalton (Part I)Abstract:In a series of talks, I will discuss parts of the paper “Uniform homeomorphisms of Banach spaces and asymptotic structure” by Nigel Kalton, which appeared posthumously in 2013 in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.. This amazingly deep paper still contains the most advanced results on the preservation of asymptotic uniform convexity under coarse-Lipschitz embeddings.The topics that will be discussed in the series are:-the preservation under coarse-Lipschitz embeddings of a natural quantitative lower bound on the fundamental function of spreading models generated by weakly null sequences. This result is a consequence of a more general result that establishes a very fine and delicate relationship between certain averages in the Banach space and its modulus of asymptotic midpoint uniform convexity.-understanding conditions under which the weak $p$-co-Banach-Saks property (a sequential property) implies $p$-asymptotic uniform convexity (a tree property). Such a condition relies on the notion of a random $L_p$-norm.-the coarse-Lipschitz rigidity of subspaces and quotients of $\\ell_p$, for $p \\in (1,\\infty)$.-the uniqueness of the coarse (or uniform) structure of $(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\ell_r^n)_{\\ell_p}$ for $1<p<r\\le 2$ or $2\\le r<p<\\infty$.",

It is a famous result, in analytic number theory, that Z_{f,p} is a rational function in Q(p^s). We give an elementary proof of this fact for a univariate polynomial f(x_1).Our proof, when combined with a fast root-counting algorithm of (Dwivedi, Mittal, Saxena, CCC, 2019), yields the *first* poly(|f|, log p) time algorithm to compute Z_{f,p}(s). We leave the same question for n=2 open.The talk is based on the joint work with Ashish Dwivedi, published in “14th Biannual Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium”, ANTS-XIV <https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/%7Esgal018/ANTS/>, 2020. Additionally, I will motivate the earlier methods, the follow-up results, and state the major open questions, in the polynomial arithmetic modulo prime-powers.",

He works at the intersection of corporations, economic sociology, political sociology, and the environment. His work focuses on how corporations mobilize politically, especially during periods of economic instability and crisis, to transform the political-legal arrangement in which they are embedded. His latest book, Normalized Financial Wrongdoing: How Re-regulating Markets Created Risk, and Increased Inequality, Stanford University Press, examines financialization of the corporation and the economy and financial malfeasance. His research won awards from the Midwest Sociological Society, American Sociological Association, Academy of Management, and the American Society of Criminology.AbstractThe purpose of this research is to understand the relationship between dimensions of the social structure and greenhouse gas emissions in U.S. fossil fueled electrical power plants. While environmental scholars have made important contributions to understanding society-environmental relations, theoretical growth and therefore the capacity to affect environmental policy is hampered by the lack of integration among different middle range perspectives. To address this issue, we adopt Robert Merton’s observation that theoretical advances require the ‘consolidation of groups of special [middle range] theories.’ We develop a conceptual framework and conduct an empirical analysis that includes core dimensions of the component parts of the social structure. We present graphs with predicted values from our regression model to illustrate the expected gas emissions, based on values of key independent variables, making complex statistical results more interpretable and meaningful.Zoom LinkRSVP Link",

This geographic heterogeneity could be consequential for Latinx children’s health care access, with prior research suggesting increased health access barriers for Latinx children in new versus established areas of settlement. Merging public-use county-level data with restricted individual-level health data from the National Health Interview Survey (2010–2014), we quantitatively examine how three health access indicators—health insurance coverage, delayed care, and usual place of care—differ among children (ages 4–17) in Latinx immigrant, Latinx U.S.-born, White U.S.-born, and Black U.S.-born families (n=89,994) across established, fast-growing hub, new, and minor Latinx destination counties. We also examine the potential roles of local immigrant hostilities and health care resources in contributing to health access differences across destinations. In fully adjusted models, children in new destinations are less likely to have health insurance than peers in established destinations, and this disparity is even wider for Latinx children of immigrants. Adjusted model results also show that children in new destinations are more likely to have delayed care than those in established destinations, and children in these four groups in new destinations, fast-growing hubs, and minor destinations are more likely to have no usual place of care than peers in established destinations. Our results are consistent with prior work suggesting that more health care access barriers exist for children, particularly Latinx children of immigrants, in new versus established Latinx destinations.BioDr. Potochnick’s research examines the social demography of immigration and how programs and policies can promote the education and health of immigrant youth. She uses an interdisciplinary perceptive to identify the health and educational needs and resources of immigrant children and families, and to examine the impact national, state, and local-level policies have on their well-being. Current projects examine how federal immigration raids and local-level immigration enforcement policies affect the mental health and school investment decisions of immigrant children at different times in their educational pathway, how pre-migration schooling and parental resources affect children’s post-migration mobility, and how settlement in new immigrant growth areas affects the health of immigrant children.",

    "event_description": "Leveraging Causal Inference and Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Personalized Dynamic Treatment RegimesIn this talk, we will present recent advancements in statistical causal learning for evaluating Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs), which allow treatments to be tailored dynamically based on evolving, subject-level data. Identifying an optimal DTR is crucial for advancing precision medicine and personalized healthcare. We first introduce a Tree-based doubly robust Reinforcement Learning (T-RL) method, which builds decision trees while retaining the strengths of batch-mode reinforcement learning. We then present a Stochastic-Tree search method, ST-RL, for evaluating optimal DTRs. ST-RL stands out in the literature due to its non-greedy policy search, and demonstrates superior performance even when handling datasets with a large number of covariates. Furthermore, we address a common challenge in real-world applications: practical constraints or “restrictions” on treatment decisions. To overcome this, we extend to a Restricted Tree-based Reinforcement Learning (RT-RL) method, which incorporates these restrictions into the learning process. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods using an observational dataset to estimate a two-stage stepped-up DTR for guiding care placement decisions for adolescents with substance use disorders. Through these developments, we aim to showcase how causal learning and reinforcement learning can significantly improve the design of personalized, adaptive treatment strategies in healthcare.",

    "event_description": "Teaching Self-Belief, One Student at a TimePresented by Wendi Zimmer, Ph.D.In the college classroom, self-doubt often hides behind silence, disengagement, or a perfectionist mindset. While we focus on content mastery and academic rigor, many of our students are quietly asking themselves,“Do I belong here?”or“Am I good enough?”This session invites faculty to consider a new lens: What if self-belief is a teachable skill, one we can model, nurture, and embed into our pedagogy?Drawing from her book,The Force Continuum,and years of research-backed work in mindset and motivation, Dr. Wendi Zimmer shares how belief-building can be seamlessly integrated into higher education environments without compromising academic expectations. Through the BELIEF Framework, participants will explore simple yet powerful ways to support students’ self-efficacy, identity development, and resilience, especially during the high-pressure moments that shape their persistence.This interactive session provides tools, language, and strategies for helping students develop the internal confidence necessary to thrive, not just academically, but also personally and professionally. Before our students can lead, they must believe, and that belief often begins with us. This session is excellent for any faculty working or mentoring students no matter the learning environment.Learning Outcomes:Articulate the role of self-beliefin student engagement, academic performance, and long-term success in higher educationRecognize belief barriers(e.g., imposter syndrome, stereotype threat, fear of failure) that commonly affect college students, particularly first-generation, underrepresented, or high-achieving populationsApply the BELIEF Frameworkto intentionally reinforce self-efficacy, voice, and identity in the college classroom through instructional choices and relational practicesIntegrate belief-building toolsinto feedback, office hours, and course design to promote academic risk-taking and resilienceReflect on personal teaching philosophyand identify key opportunities to embed belief-building strategies into their discipline-specific instructionLeave with actionable strategiesfor creating a culture of belief, one that affirms potential, challenges fixed narratives, and helps students develop a durable sense of purpose and belongingAttend in-person (Rudder 301) orvirtually.REGISTER TO ATTEND",

Writing means brainstorming, outlining, generating, or revising texts. Write Line is not a time for grading or running data analyses– it is dedicated writing time!Each group has a dedicated facilitator who provides brief revision and writing techniques at the beginning of each session. These tips can be applied during your Write Line time.Participants will log their goals for the day in a shared document for the accountability and community of striving toward goals together.Participants with quick writing questions can get answers from the facilitator via the Zoom chat function.At the end of each session, the groups briefly reconvene to add their writing progress and share future goals.Write Line is about building a regular writing routine, but we recognize that graduate students have many commitments that are scheduled or arranged beyond their control. If you miss your Write Line session for the week, you may join another session and report your goals in your assigned group’s writing progress log. Due to the popularity of Write Line, students who miss more than two weeks of Write Line will be removed from the program.Write Line is now part of theGRAD Aggies Certificate Programand counts for 2 PDU credits when you attend and participate in at least seven of the 10 sessions.NOTE: Write Line is not a class or workshop.

    "event_description": "Despite hundreds of searches, no clear evidence of beyond standard model particles have been found at the LHC so far. However, there still remains a huge landscape of possible signals hiding in LHC data, which is very difficult to fully cover with traditional strategies. Recently, a new class of ‘anomaly detection’ techniques have been developed which aim to cover as much of this landscape as possible so that potential discoveries are not missed. These techniques leverage novel data-driven machine learning methods to minimize the trade-off between sensitivity and model independence. In this talk, I will present results from the first application of anomaly detection in CMS : a search for resonances decaying to two jets with ‘anomalous’ substructure. I will also discuss future prospects for these exciting new AI techniques more broadly, and how they may play a key role in a future, robust LHC search program.",

These cosmic explosions are responsible for synthesizing and dispersing heavy elements, enriching galaxies with the building blocks necessary for planet formation and life itself. Supernovae inject vast amounts of energy into their surrounding environments, influencing star formation and galactic evolution. Understanding these events is key to unraveling the chemical history of the universe and the cycle of stellar life and death. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these core collapse supernovae are not well understood. I will discuss how we probe these explosions and their complex environments using polarized light. I will discuss the current state of the field of spectropolarimetry, along with the state-of-the-art modeling efforts used to interpret observed polarimetric data.",

Strikingly, this background can be highly anisotropic on large scales, directly reflecting axion fluctuations and offering a new observable beyond the CMB and large-scale structure, which trace adiabatic inflaton perturbations. I will discuss the dynamics of axion rotation, the resulting gravitational-wave signal and its anisotropy, and the prospects for probing this distinctive signature with future detectors.",

    "event_summary": "W. Saslow, TAMU",
    "event_description": "There is now experimental evidence that a material can be both crystalline and superfluid, a seemingly impossible combination that has been studied theoretically for over fifty years, and quite recently experimentally. We first briefly review superfluidity, dating from the 1930’s and responsible for numerous Nobel Prizes. In 1969 Andreev and Lifshitz argued that the superfluidity of a solid is based on defect motion, proposed that such systems can have both superfluid and normal fluid components, and developed a dynamical theory for such a system. In 1970 Leggett argued that such a system has an overall quantum-mechanical phase whose gradient defines a superfluid velocity, and leads to a non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI). For a brief time around 2004 it was thought that solid 4He displays NCRI, but additional measurements showed that the observed effect was due to defects. However, in 2023 experiments on BEC dilute atomic solids revealed extra scattering spots when such a solid is rotated, which was interpreted as vortex line formation associated with superfluidity. Taking Leggett’s phase-flow viewpoint, we argue that at temperature T=0 a crystalline superfluid will have a superfluid fraction less than one, and thus missing mass. We resolve this by attributing a mass-bearing velocity to the solid. At finite T this system will have excitations and therefore a normal fluid velocity. Thus we consider that a supersolid has three mass-bearing velocities, each with its own velocity and response. We develop the dynamical theory of this system and discuss its expected experimental properties.",

    "event_description": "There are several methods of handling the highly nonlinear system of the Einstein field equations in order to derive the exact solutions or to extract the salient features of the corresponding spacetime dynamics. One such approach is the semi-tetrad covariant formalism of gravity. The semi-tetrad methods are the 1 + 3 covariant approach developed by Ehlers in 1961 and Ellis in 1971, and the 1 + 1 + 2 covariant approach developed by Clarkson and Barrett in 2003. The 1+3 formalism has generated new results in gauge-invariant study and specific spacetimes, among others. An extension of the 1+3 covariant approach is the 1+1+2 covariant approach, which has generated new results in locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes in General Relativity, and also illustrated other important features of gravitational dynamics, including gravitational collapse. I will offer a brief exposition to these two formalisms and discuss a few applications with particular reference to the 1 + 1 + 2 approach.",

We use projected stream morphologies to constrain the shape and barycenter of each host galaxy’s potential, jointly probing baryonic and dark matter distributions. These inferences complement lensing, with sensitivity to halo geometry on tens of kpc scales. The method enables both stacked, population-level constraints on halo triaxiality and barycenters, and individual-halo inference on the same. Already, we find promising agreement with ΛCDM predictions. Our program will identify thousands of streams, enabling precise constraints on halo shapes and barycenters across large samples and redshifts, offering a new dynamical test of dark structures.",

Exceptions can be made; we just ask that any such requests are communicated to us in a timely manner (ideally as part of the application process).",
    "event_description": "ELIGIBILITY: Full-time faculty members for whom research is a formal component of their annual assessment are eligible to apply. Faculty must not have received an Interdisciplinary Faculty Seed Grant in the previous two years or a Faculty Small Research Seed Grants in the previous year.These awards are designed to address a need for funding for research that could not be accomplished otherwise in order to complete a book project, major article, or series of articles, or other equivalent research projects that makes an impact in the faculty member’s field and/or race and ethnic studies in general.Funds may be used for fieldwork, travel to archives, research materials, data sets, survey instruments, participant incentives, software, or other normally reimbursable expenses. The grant is not intended solely as a small grant to attend a conference, although proposals that include (or will lead to) presentations at conferences and workshops are strongly encouraged. The budget may not include stipend/salary or course buyouts. A portion of the funds may be used to support a graduate student working on the project, but the majority of the work should be undertaken by the awarded faculty member. For any questions about how the funds may be used, please contact RESI well before the deadline. Funds will be given as a bursary to be managed by the faculty member’s home department.Pending space availability, faculty will be invited to present at theRESI Faculty Colloquium Series. Awardees should acknowledge the Race & Ethnic Studies Institute in any resulting publications, presentations, or other work products funded; and will be asked to submit updates on their progress and products. Projects will be chosen on the basis of their intellectual rigor, scholarly creativity, and potential to make a significant impact in the candidate’s field and race and ethnic studies generally.FUNDING PRIORITIES: The Race & Ethnic Studies Institute is dedicated to fostering, celebrating, and producing cutting edge research related to race and ethnic studies. A wide range of research projects that examine the salience of race and ethnicity are of interest to RESI, however, proposals connecting to theRESI HSI Research Initiativeportfolio areparticularly encouraged. Texas A&M University is amongst the largest and most well resourced (in terms of total annual research expenditures) Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the country. RESI is strongly committed to building our university’s profile in HSI-related research. To best focus our research investment, we expect that somewhere between half and two-thirds of grants made will be channeled into the HSI Research Initiative portfolio.",

    "event_summary": "Course SummarySevere traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) in young patients can result in unrestorable teeth or replacement resorption and ankylosis with the potential for infra-occlusion in growing children. Extraction is often the treatment rendered in these cases. When permanent teeth are subsequently extracted, long-term complications are likely. The supporting bone will be lost, creating the need for additional interventions later in life when the patient is ready for a more permanent option to rehabilitate the area. In the meantime, young, growing patients have limited prosthetic options if a tooth is lost. Bone preservation in young patients is of paramount importance. When patients are ready for definitive tooth replacement (eg. implant), previous bone preservation can make the process simpler and less costly as the need for bone and soft tissue augmentation may be minimal or unnecessary. This presentation will cover a series of clinical cases where bone preservation strategies were employed when treating young patients following severe TDIs. This presentation will emphasize how a multidisciplinary approach is paramount to achieve optimal results, where the endodontist needs to collaborate with periodontists, oral surgeons, orthodontists and general dentists.REGISTER:https://reg.learningstream.com/reg/event_page.aspx?ek=0069-0031-d1f4b6742b994ee897de8e0a2b173643",

    "event_description": "Residents of Walker and Grimes County are invited to water well screenings and education meetings.TheTexas Well Owner Network, TWON, is holding an upcoming event on October 27-28. This program allows residents to have their private well water screened, as well as provide education training for groundwater protection. This event is hosted by the Bluebonnet Groundwater Conservation District, the Grimes County AgriLife Extension office and the Walker County AgriLife Extension office. It is open to the public and free to attend, lunch will be provided.Joel Pigg,Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Serviceprogram specialist, College Station, said the Texas Well Owner Network program is for Texas residents who depend on household wells for their water needs.“The TWON program was established to help well owners become familiar with Texas groundwater resources, septic system maintenance, well maintenance and construction, and water quality and treatment,” he said.Water samples will be screened for contaminants, including total coliform bacteria, E. coli bacteria, nitrate-nitrogen and salinity.Sampling instructionsPlease use a new bottle of water (12-20 ounces), pour out the contents and fill it with a water sample from your private water well. Take the sample from the spigot/hose bib nearest to the well head. Remove the water hose if there is one and take directly from the spigot/hose bib. If an inside faucet is used, you will need to remove the aerator on faucet before making the collection. Rinse and dry the exterior of the faucet to prevent exterior contamination of your water sample. If possible, wipe off with a Clorox-type towelette or paper towel wetted with a light bleach solution to kill any bacteria present on the faucet.Allow the solution to dry before sampling.Turn on the water full force and let it run at full force for two minutes or until you hear the pump start running. Reduce the water flow to a small stream and collect the sample.Refrigerate the sample and transport it to the workshop (in an ice chest) as soon after collection as possible. It is best to collect the day of the workshop if possible ;otherwise make sure the sample is kept cool and out of direct sunlight. Sample should be collected within 24 hours before the workshop to ensure accurate results.We encourage you to bring samples from all wells on your property; many participants that have water treatment equipment take samples before and after treatment to make sure the equipment is functioning properly. We need for you to label the sample with your name (if you bring more than one sample you also need to label the sample in a way to make sure you know which well the sample comes from). We will be screening for Nitrates, TDS (salinity) and bacteria (absence or presence of coliform and E. coli) with your sample.There will be a $15 per sample charge for this water well screening and you may bring as many samples as you would like.Pigg said it is essential for those submitting samples to be at the follow-up meeting to receive results, learn corrective measures for identified problems and improve their understanding of private well management.Water contaminants concernsPigg said research shows the presence ofE. colibacteria in water indicates that waste from humans or warm-blooded animals may have contaminated the water. Water contaminated withE. coliis more likely to also have pathogens that can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea or other symptoms.The presence of nitrate-nitrogen in well water is also a concern, and water with nitrate-nitrogen at levels of 10 parts per million is considered unsafe for human consumption, he said.“These nitrate levels above 10 parts per million can disrupt the ability of blood to carry oxygen throughout the body, resulting in a condition called methemoglobinemia,” Pigg said. “Infants less than 6 months of age are the most susceptible to this.”Salinity, as measured by total dissolved solids, will also be determined for each sample, he said. Water with high levels may leave deposits and have a salty taste. Using water with high levels for irrigation may damage soil or plants.To learn more about the program or to find additional publications and resources, visittwon.tamu.edu. For more information on the water screening contact Pigg at 979-321-5946 orj-pigg@tamu.edu.The screenings are presented by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension andTexas Water Resources Institute, TWRI.Funding for TWON are through a Clean Water Act Section 319(h) nonpoint source grant provided by theTexas State Soil and Water Conservation Boardand theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The project is managed by TWRI, part ofTexas A&M AgriLife Research, AgriLife Extension and theTexas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.For more information specific to the workshop, contact the Grimes County AgriLife Extension office at 936-873-3907, Walker County AgriLife Extension Office at 936-435-2426, or the Bluebonnet Groundwater Conservation District at 936-825-7303 or Joel Pigg atj-pigg@tamu.eduor 979-321-5946.",

    "event_summary": "Many times the discussion around learning and neurodiversity is deficit based. While it is important to consider the very real learning challenges that many neurodiverse students face in higher education, it is equally critical to highlight the numerous strengths associated with different neurotypes such as ADHD, learning disabilities, autism, mental health challenges and consider ways to help students leverage strengths for learning. This workshop will provide participants with an overview of neurodiversity and explore what a strength based and neuroaffirming perspective entails. Participants will consider how learning environments can interact with neurodiversity to mobilize strengths or heighten challenges, and explore neuro-affirming instructional strategies to lower unintentional barriers to learning. By the end of this workshop, participants will be prepared to:Describe the tenets of a neurodiversity affirming paradigm and some neurodiversity related strengths and challengesIdentify some neuro-affirming instructional strategies that can help to mobilize neurodiversity-related strengths and lower learning barriersAnalyze your current instructional approach for neuro-affirming strategies that you currently utilizing or could integrate into your teaching",

We offer 15 graduate programs, with many nationally ranked, and we want to provide opportunities for students around the world to learn more about what Texas A&M can offer and what it means to be an Aggie Engineer.Texas A&M’s Aggie Network is unlike any other, and the opportunities and resources we can provide will enhance the value of your engineering degree. We believe it is a special experience to earn a degree at Texas A&M, which is why we have developed a virtual fair and created an opportunity for you to speak with our graduate advisor team and learn more about what the Texas A&M experience is all about.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is a Virtual Grad Fair?This is your opportunity to chat with Texas A&M graduate advisors about anything related to Texas A&M’s graduate school. Our advisors can fill you in on department-specific admission expectations, facilities and labs, funding, research, student organizations, and more.Do I need to register for this event?Yes, you will need to register to attend the event. You can register here.Who will I be able to chat with during the virtual event?Each participating department will have two advisors available to chat. Our graduate advisors are frequently thought of as the first point-of-contact for everything related to their respective graduate degree program. They are knowledgeable about every aspect of their program, including their admission requirements, faculty, labs, funding opportunities, and more. Departments vary in what they are looking for in students and what they can offer to you, which is why the graduate advisor is the best person to ask for specifics.Why should I attend this event?Often times, students chat with university representatives who are knowledgeable about the university as a whole, but they may not have specific knowledge about individual departments. Each graduate advisor represents one department, and therefore, they are incredibly knowledgeable about everything related to that department. The opportunity to chat with our graduate advisors before you arrive on campus is invaluable, as they can fill you in on department-specific admission expectations, facilities and labs, funding, student organizations, and more. Our graduate advisors are the best people to talk to when you want to know the small details about a program that make it unique.Can I log-in to the event at a later date?Yes.

    "event_description": "Abstract:From the phones in our pockets to the televisions on our walls, liquid crystalline materials have transformed how we live and interact with technology. A fascinating branch of this materials family are liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs). LCEs merge the molecular order of liquid crystals with the elasticity of polymers. The result is a class of soft materials that can bend, twist, and contract-like muscle when stimulated by heat, light, or electric fields.In this seminar, I will describe how molecular design, supramolecular interactions, and advanced processing approaches are used to control and amplify the remarkable responsiveness of LCEs.I will highlight recent efforts in 3D printing and alignment that expand their capabilities, and I will emphasize how these “soft muscles” are inspiring new applications in robotics, adaptive optics, and health care.Bio:Timothy J. White is the Gallogly Professor of Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. Tim received his Ph.D. in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering in 2006 from the University of Iowa and subsequently joined the Air Force Research Laboratory where he served as a Senior Research Engineer and Technology Advisor of the Photonic Materials Branch.In 2018, Tim joined the faculty at the University of Colorado Boulder. Tim leads the “Responsive and Programmable Materials” Group, pursuing research generally focused on programming functional responses in organized materials. Prof. White has more than 200 papers in peer-reviewed journals.Dr. White has been honored with the 2019 Soft Matter Lectureship, 2016 Materials Research Society “Outstanding Young Investigator” award, the 2013 SPIE Early Career Achievement award, the 2013 American Chemical Society PMSE Division Award for “Cooperative Research in Applied Polymer Science”, and the 2012 Air Force Early Career Award.",

These findings not only shed light on the fundamental optical properties of hBN but also pave the way for leveraging its wide bandgap and excitonic behavior in emerging quantum photonic technologies.Bio:Dr.Cong Su is an assistant professor in the Department of Materials Science and Department of Applied Physics at Yale University. He is also affiliated to Yale’s Energy Science Institute and Center for Materials Innovation.Cong was a Kavli Postdoctoral Fellow (Heising-Simons Junior Fellow) at UC Berkeley, and he got his Ph.D. from MIT and his bachelor’s from Peking University.Cong’s research focuses on atom control using electron beam, photonics and interfaces in semiconductors, and 2D materials synthesis.",

This simple concept is a powerful tool to understand fundamental mechanisms, solve problems, improve sustainability, and establish design principles across a wide variety of fields. The Lamb group takes a physical organic approach to problems at the interface of polymer science and catalysis to transform how materials are made and un-made. Much of our work has been on polyoxazolidinones (POxa), which are an emerging polyurethane subclass for high-performance thermoplastic/electronic applications that have high thermal stability due to the five-membered heterocycles incorporated into the polymer backbone. We address many synthetic limitations of POxa and systematically investigate their structure-property relationships, particularly the effect of the strong, oriented Oxa dipole on material properties.",

Thus, methods to directly introduce nitrogen into simple precursors in an efficient, selective manner are of interest. The prevalence of C–H bonds make them ideal for direct functionalization to value-upgraded compounds; however, it can be challenging to target one specific C–H bond. Our group harnesses unusual features of silver(I) salts supported by diverse N-dentate ligands to catalyze selective nitrene transfer (NT) reactions that convert C–H bonds to C–N bonds in a tunable manner. Selected design principles and computational insights that underpin our ability to predictably tune the chemo-, site-, and stereoselectivity of silver-catalyzed NT will be presented, along with synthetic applications.",

Who gets priority for a life-saving organ donation?These outcomes are not a matter of luck. Instead, they depend on how we navigate hidden markets that arise to decide wo gets what when many of us want something and there isn’t enough to go around. Every day we play in these markets, yet few of us fully understand how they work.In familiar markets, what we get depends on how much we’re willing to pay. Hidden markets do not rely on prices: you can’t buy your way in to a better position. Instead, what you receive hinges on the rules by which the market operates and the choices you make in them.Judd Kessler has spent a career studying and designing these very markets. Now, he reveals the secrets of how they work and how to maneuver in them.

    "event_description": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is transforming our understanding on galaxy formation and evolution, revealing distant galaxies deep into the epoch of reionization and red sources that were simply unknown previously. In this talk, I will present some of the most surprising discoveries of the JWST era. I will begin with one of JWST’s first deep fields, the A2744 cluster field, targeted as part of the UNCOVER survey. This rich, public dataset, reveals stellar populations across 0.2 < z < 13, and helps to lead to the discovery of some of the most distant galaxies known to date. I will then turn to a new population of compact red sources, revealed by JWST’s optical and infrared sensitivity. Initially interpreted as apparently massive galaxies at z > 7, these objects imply a strongly accelerated timeline compared to standard models of galaxy growth. Yet, major uncertainties remain about their nature. I will show detailed studies of these so-far mysterious “little red dots”, enabled by the spectroscopic data from the RUBIES program. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks will be explored, from the cores of massive galaxies to black holes embedded in a dense hydrogen cloud. I will conclude with remaining puzzles and possible future directions to form a complete physical picture of these intriguing systems.",

    "event_description": "Abstract:Chemical processes hinge on the dynamic rearrangement of nuclei within molecules. Controlling these motions with precision has been a long-standing goal in chemistry. My lab focuses on achieving this by manipulating interactions between individual molecules and their nanoscale environment. We engineer the potential energy surface at this scale to control molecular properties such as structure and reactivity.Using vibrational characterization techniques with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)—including inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, action spectroscopy, and our recent advancement in single-molecule infrared absorption spectroscopy—we analyze molecular responses to the variation in the nano-chemical environment by examining their fingerprinting vibrational modes at the sub-molecular scale. By precisely tuning the junction geometry, material, and the interaction between the molecule and other surface entities, we can selectively influence specific bonds, paving the way for bond-selective control in chemistry.Bio:Dr. Shaowei Li is an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. He received B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Nankai University in 2010 and Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California, Irvine in 2017. Before joining UC San Diego, he was a postdoc scholar at Northwestern University and later a Heising-Simons Junior Fellow at UC Berkeley. His research focuses on probing the fundamental properties of low-dimensional systems including single molecules and layered materials with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. His group combines scanning tunneling microscopy with optical spectroscopy to explore light-matter interaction at the atomic scale.",

    "event_description": "Chatbots like ChatGPT may seem magical, but what’s really going on inside their “brains”? The answer is Transformers—a breakthrough in artificial intelligence. Unlike older models that read words one at a time, transformers look at an entire sentence (or even a whole paragraph) at once, figuring out how each word relates to the others. This “attention” trick allows large language models (LLMs) to generate smooth, meaningful text, translate languages, and even hold conversations that feel natural. In this talk, we’ll break down the magic behind transformers using simple examples, explore how models learn from huge amounts of data, and play with the “settings” that shape their personality—like temperature (how creative the AI sounds) and top-k (how many word options it considers). By the end, you’ll understand not only how these models work, but also why they’re changing the way we study, work, and create.",

Advising offices can create practices and resources that give structure and support to the learning process for new advisors, and NACADA’s Core Competencies and New Advisor Development Chart provide a map of what should be learned. Yet the process of creating comprehensive training and development programs from the ground up can feel daunting (if not impossible). This webinar’s hosts will share their experiences creating structures to support new advisor learning and break down their developments into manageable steps for implementation. We will help you dream big in design and think small in implementation to see your interventions compound changes over time (and will include a few helpful resources to get started with those small changes).",
