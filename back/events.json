Noon–6 p.m; Closed Sun.–Mon.Regular Hours | Beginning Aug. 26, 2025Tues.–Fri. 9 a.m.–8 p.m.; Sat.–Sun. Noon–6 p.m; Closed Mon.Comprised of lithographs, woodcuts and etchings, this exhibition brings together powerful works that reflect the vital role artists played—and continue to play—in shaping the public consciousness of war and memory. These prints serve as both documentary records and poetic interpretations, capturing not only the devastation and resilience of people and places but also the emotional landscape of a world transformed by conflict.Drawing on Francis Brennan’s 1942 call that the American people needed their artists “to charge them with the grave responsibility of spelling out their anger, their grief, their greatness and their justice,” the exhibition honors those who responded through the enduring medium of printmaking—bearing witness, telling stories that history books cannot and offering deeply personal visions of collective experience.",

Those who love and appreciate the collection have, in turn, donated or loaned a significant number of items including paperweights, Asian art, early American pewter, American Brilliant Cut Crystal, 19thcentury quilts, small furniture items, as well as additional paintings, works on paper and art glass. This exhibition celebrates their generosity and, we hope, will inspire others to share their treasures with the University. THANK YOU!To inquire about donating works of late 19thand early 20thart or to make a contribution to the Forsyth Galleries, contact Assistant Director and Curator Elizabeth Appleby ateappleby@tamu.edu.",

Notices are posted at the Memorial Student Center, Evans Library, and at the base of the flagpole in front of the Academic Building. At 10:15 p.m., chimes from the Albritton Bell Tower begin to play. The ceremony begins at 10:30 p.m. as the Ross Volunteers Firing Squad marches in slow cadence to the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross. Three volleys are fired. “Silver Taps” is played by six buglers three times – to the North, West, and South. This concludes the ceremony, but not the feelings of respect and honor.With respect, the ceremony of Silver Taps is dedicated to the deceased Aggie and is a solemn and serious event. Some important observances must be remembered:The area in front of the Sul Ross statue and the Academic Building is reserved for the friends and family of the deceased.Aggies do not stand or sit on the benches lining the walkway between the flagpole and the Sul Ross Statue.The darkness and quiet, which cover the campus, emphasize the mood for Silver Taps. Aggies help to retain this tranquility by covering windows, keeping noise to a minimum, and walking to and from the ceremony without talking.The name of the deceased Aggie is posted on the flagpole base during the day of Silver Taps.",

Negroponte, who will speak about President George H.W. Bush’s vision for free trade across the Americas and establishment of the North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA).RSVPThis event is highly relevant today as debates over free trade, regional integration, and global competition continue to shape U.S. economic policy. Ambassador (ret.) John Negroponte’s reflections on President George H.W. Bush’s vision for the North American Free Trade Agreement provide valuable historical context for current discussions about supply chains, economic resilience, and international partnerships. For Texas A&M students, the talk offers an opportunity to connect theory with practice, learn from a distinguished diplomat, and better understand how trade policy influences both global dynamics and local economic opportunities in Texas.Negroponte has served as Ambassador to Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines, the United Nations, and Iraq. He served twice on the National Security Council staff, first as Director for Vietnam in the Nixon Administration and then as Deputy National Security Advisor under President Reagan. He has also held a cabinet level position as the first Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush. His most recent position in government was as Deputy Secretary of State, where he served as the State Department’s Chief Operating Officer.The ConocoPhillips White House Lecture Series is sponsored by ConocoPhillips of Houston, Texas, whose 2002 endowment to the George and Barbara Bush Foundation established the program. The Lecture Series brings to public attention the various offices of the White House and Executive Branch that provide policy, administrative, and overall support to the President. The purpose is to bring to life the workings of the White House, a better understanding of the governmental process, and an opportunity to examine and understand the particular function and challenges of each office. In this manner, the series provides a more comprehensive picture of the Presidency and the people around the President.",

    "event_summary": "University structure/governance varies little across the world and has changed little in basic form across time. It is, at its essence, deeply colonial and Western, characterized by a hierarchical distribution of power. However, as the world changes rapidly around us, there is a growing need to authentically include the diverse voices of stakeholders (i.e., staff and students) in the decisions that affect their work, learning, and wellbeing. This course presents a shared governance model, “Sociocracy”, that stresses inclusion and deliberate attention to power dynamics. Based on consent and not consensus, sociocracy operates at scales from small groups to entire organizations. Participants will explore connections among governance/decision-making, power structures, and participatory equity in higher education. They will explore sociocracy as a model for fostering shared decision-making in classrooms, committees, departments, and other academic spaces, and generate actionable plans to improve power dynamics and advance equity and inclusion in their own contexts. By the end of this course, participants will be able to:Identify relationships, power structures, and/or gaps in participatory equity in governance at their home institution.Define, explain, and justify the use of Sociocracy as a viable governance model at multiple levels or scales.Explain the significance of sociocratic structures and processes.Design sociocratic structures at levels or scales relevant to their local contexts.The course will also prepare participants to apply practical strategies that foster more equitable, inclusive, and participatory forms of leadership. These approaches are adaptable to a wide range of settings and contexts. Participants will learn how to:Structure and facilitate meetings effectively.Engage students as active partners in course design and learning.Incorporate regular feedback loops to improve processes, strengthen decision-making, and enhance collaborative projects.",

Why does Florida swing during presidential elections?” Contrary to popular assumptions about Florida voting patterns, Florida’s Latino vote is not determined by a monolithic voting-bloc. Rather, multiple generations of immigrants from across the Caribbean and the Americas— all of whom have conflicting politics, migration motivations, and concepts of self— shape, and have long shaped, election outcomes in the state. As Florida becomes a testing ground for national policies, understanding the history that created the state becomes increasingly essential. In this presentation, I will introduce her project as well as community engaged work that amplifies connections between scholarship and public application of research.MitraIn 2020,Timemagazine named Bilkis Bano, an octogenarian protestor from Delhi, among the 100 most influential people in the world, referring to her as “the dadi from Shaheen Bagh.” The Shaheen Bagh movement (2019–2020) became a landmark in Indian anti-fascist resistance, as elderly Muslim women led mass protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), which sought to disenfranchise undocumented minorities. This paper examines Bilkis’ 2020 interview onNews 18 Urdu, highlighting how the affectionate and intimate figure of thedadi(grandmother) reconfigures assumptions about political agency, gender, and age. I argue that the centrality of elderly Muslim women in Shaheen Bagh illuminates the affective politics of belonging, citizenship, and intergenerational resistance in contemporary India.Chair: Rick Pulos | Communication & JournalismPlease note that this is not a lecture, and thus, is not suited for class attendance.

    "event_description": "Presenters:Ilayda Onder, Assistant Professor | Political Science“Performative Rebel Governance and Legibility: Evidence from Southeast Turkey”Noah Crawford, Ph.D. Student | History“‘Humanity’s Cause’: The International Dimensions of the American Civil War Refugee Crisis”Abstracts:OnderRebel groups often engage in performative governance acts that mimic the symbolic repertoires of sovereign states (e.g., printing currency, holding funeral rites, or building mausoleums). How do these acts shape rebel-constituency ties? I conceptualize performative rebel governance as a legibility-oriented strategy for identifying loyal civilians in harder-to-reach communities—those beyond the rebels’ immediate networks. Yet, these same acts also increase the legibility of rebellion to the state, exposing pro-rebel civilians to surveillance and paradoxically trading off the ability to expand rebels’ mobilization base beyond their traditional networks for an overall decline in mobilization. I provide evidence for this theory using original spatial event data on the funeral rites of PKK fighters in Southeast Turkey with microdata on PKK recruitment. The findings show that while funeral rites increase the recruitment of women and individuals with no history of political activism or family ties to the rebel movement, overall recruitment declines. These results reveal an inherent dilemma in rebel governance in contested spaces: while governance helps insurgents overcome informational deficiencies by eliciting civilian agency to reveal allegiances, it simultaneously renders the social landscape of war more legible to the government side of the conflict.CrawfordAs Union and Confederate armies battled to the east, the Texas-Mexico border region along the Rio Grande became a hotspot for refugee activity as pro-Union Texans fled to Mexico—a fellow republican state—that had already abolished slavery. By 1863, northern Mexico was embroiled in a civil war of its own as imperial France tried to install a European-style state on Mexico. Unionists in Mexico were surprised to find solidarity with Liberal Republican Mexican forces and even joined forces to combat Confederate Texans and French soldiers alike. The principles of transnational republicanism drew the United States and the Republic of Mexico together during the 1860s and reinforced the principles of an abolitionist ballad that encouraged its listeners to heed “humanity’s call.” This paper contextualizes the American Civil War’s refugee crisis as part of a larger nineteenth century Atlantic world that blended liberation ideology with republican principles.Chair: Seulgiye Kim | EnglishPlease note that this is not a lecture, and thus, is not suited for class attendance.

The project addresses how Russian officials at the turn of the nineteenth century faced a colonial problem that they realized required innovation: the long-coveted Caucasus region could not be annexed through the traditional use of Cossack cavalry and Slavic settlers alone. For help, they turned to Western Europe. My book shows how and why tsarist officials “outsourced” certain tasks of empire building. Romanov imperialists improvised a trial-and-error program of tolerating the settlement of Scottish missionaries, French silk barons, German schismatics, and Swiss evangelicals in these strategically vital borderlands. With both alacrity and apprehension, the Russian state hoped to secure the sociopolitical stability and economic vitality of its Caucasus dominion through the collaboration of foreign expatriates.NyquistMore information forthcoming.Chair: Zachary Stewart | ArchitecturePlease note that this is not a lecture, and thus, is not suited for class attendance.

And he will present new evidence on the factors predicting whether college students progress through the early teacher pipeline.Bio:Dr. Dan Goldhaber is the Director of the Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER,caldercenter.org) at the American Institutes for Research and the Director of the Center for Education Data & Research (CEDR) at the University of Washington. Both CALDER and CEDR are focused on using state administrative data to do research that informs decisions about policy and practice.Dan’s work focuses on issues of educational productivity and reform at the K-12 level, the broad array of human capital policies that influence the composition, distribution, and quality of teachers in the workforce, and connections between students’ K-12 experiences and  post-secondary outcomes. Topics of published work in this area include studies of the stability of value-added measures of teachers, the effects of teacher qualifications and quality on student achievement, and the impact of teacher pay structure and licensure on the teacher labor market.",

In this talk, I will present “a family of 3D algorithms that make reconstruction, rendering, and generation practical on real workloads, together with a scalable 3D data engine spanning human avatars, Martian-surface” simulation, and cryo-EM microscopy. First, I will cover: (1) city-scale 3D reconstruction and a real-time 3D perception Transformer that operates from uncalibrated images; (2) efficient neural rendering techniques that achieve 60% speedup over 3D Gaussian Splatting while preserving fidelity; and (3) methods by which explicit 3D understanding augments 2D vision–language models to improve spatial awareness prior to reasoning. Next, I will introduce systematic remedies for 3D data scarcity: (1) an automated pipeline for multimodal human-avatar and environment annotation; (2) a reliable system for simulating Martian surfaces under limited texture availability; and (3) a learned inverse Fourier-slicing map that enables cryo-EM reconstructions up to 10× faster without sacrificing accuracy. Taken together, these advances move us toward AI systems that interact with the physical world with genuine spatial understanding and real-time performance.BIO:Zhiwen (“Aaron”) Fan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University.

    "event_description": "Abstract:Newton–Raphson (NR) power flow can readily converge to alternative, non-operational solutions. Using visualizations of the region of attraction (ROA), the paper demonstrates that the routine flat start (1 p.u., 0°) often lies outside the basin of the desired operating point, especially in large systems. Guided by these diagnostics, three computationally tractable approaches are evaluated: (i) rectangular-form NR with an optimal multiplier, (ii) voltage-dependent load switching from constant-power to constant-current/impedance below thresholds, and (iii) a lightweight pre-solve heuristic that adjusts initial voltages at buses implicated by extreme initial branch-flow mismatches. The results deliver a clear geometric understanding of NR behavior and practical applications that integrate with existing solvers.BIO:Kseniia is a 3rd-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering (Energy and Power Group) at Texas A&M University in Professor Overbye’s group.

    "event_description": "Wang Abstract:As power systems become increasingly dominated by renewable resources interfaced through power electronic inverters, achieving stable and flexible grid synchronization is a critical challenge. Conventional Grid-Forming (GFM) and Grid-Following (GFL) inverters offer complementary capabilities, but are typically treated as separate paradigms, making seamless transitions between modes difficult. This talk presents a hybrid GFM–GFL control framework based on Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC), which integrates both power-synchronization and droop-synchronization mechanisms within the Andronov–Hopf nonlinear oscillator. The proposed approach enables multi-mode operation: the inverter can function as either Frequency-Forming or Frequency-Following, and as either Voltage-Forming or Voltage-Following. By adjusting the strength of grid feedback signals, smooth and continuous transitions trajectories between these operating modes are achieved. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through simulations, highlighting seamless on-grid transitions and robust performance in islanded operation.Wang Biography:Xiaoyang Wang is a second-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University, working with Dr. Xin Chen in the Smart Power, Energy, and Decision-making (SPEED) Lab. He earned his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Electrical Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU). His research focuses on the modeling, parameter identification, and control of inverter-based resource (IBR)-rich power systems. He has been awarded the 2024–2025 ECE Graduate Merit Fellowship and the 2025–2026 Thomas Powell ’62 Fellowship.Szymanowski Abstract:The growing use of distributed generation, electric vehicles, demand response, and advanced metering infrastructure has increased the coupling between transmission and distribution networks. Because these systems are traditionally modeled under different assumptions, integrated analysis is both challenging and computationally demanding. This paper compares two power flow methods—back-and-forth co-simulation and direct full-system modeling—on both a small test system and the 150-bus Travis County synthetic grid. Results show that the back-and-forth approach achieves fewer iterations and shorter runtimes for complex systems, with little to no difference in final voltage profiles.Szymanowski Biography:Bart Szymanowski received his bachelor’s degrees in applied mathematics and physics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2023. He is now pursuing graduate studies in power systems at Texas A&M University and has gained experience at ISOs across the country.

    "event_description": "Abstract:In big data settings, identifying critical data and variables—essential for efficient computation, robust estimation, and explainable AI—is often like finding needles in a haystack. This talk explores how to locate such “needles” in stochastic simulation for estimating rare-event probabilities and in digital twin calibration, a problem of both theoretical and practical importance. Rare events typically occur under specific input conditions. Yet as dimensionality increases, the search space expands exponentially while the regions driving rare events occupy an increasingly sparse fraction of the overall volume. This phenomenon makes the design of efficient sampling strategies particularly challenging. We address this challenge using two variance reduction techniques: stratified sampling and importance sampling. For stratified sampling, we derive the optimal stratification structure for univariate settings and extend it via decision trees to develop a robust algorithm for multi-dimensional problems. For importance sampling, we propose a novel dimension-reduction method tailored to stochastic simulation. This approach balances concentrating on key variables with broader exploration, thereby reducing variance and improving estimator robustness. Finally, we discuss extensions to digital twin calibration, where massive datasets, high-dimensional parameters, and block-structured data introduce additional computational challenges.Bio:Dr. Eunshin Byon is a Professor and Richard Wilson Scholar in the Industrial and Operations Engineering Department at the University of Michigan, where she also serves as Director of the IOE Master’s Program.

A global population of 9 billion people by 2050 along with supply chain disruptions provide unique opportunities for the deployment of new technologies for metals extraction and processing, when powered by electricity[1]. For commodity metals such as iron, aluminum and copper, this is inherently achieved via the molten state, supporting higher productivity and better-quality control[2]. This seminar highlights how materials science and engineering has a key role in enabling such transformation, starting with a survey of a subset of processes and the past contributions of the field, and the new frontiers investigated in our laboratory.Recent advances are then presented, pertinent to new process technologies such as electrolysis [3,4,5] or sulfidation for primary minerals separation and metal recycling [6,7,8,9], as well as scientific concepts and tools to access the physical-chemistry and thermodynamic of the molten state [10,11].Bio:Antoine Allanore is Professor of Metallurgy in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the recipient of the Heather N.

    "event_description": "Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) include a variety of designs currently under exploration, featuring thermal, or fast spectrum, with either fluoride or chloride salts, currently proposed as micro or small modular reactors. A key focus of the MSR program is to determine the thermochemical and thermophysical properties of molten salts, both with and without fission products. Six U.S. national laboratories and several universities are gathering experimental and computational data to support reactor design, licensing, and operation, which is being compiled into two databases. In liquid-fueled MSRs, gaseous fission products exhibit low solubility in the fuel salt, leading to their transfer to the gas phase. For any future liquid-fueled MSR to meet U.S. licensing requirements, efficient monitoring and capture of some volatile radionuclides from reactor off-gas streams will be essential. These radionuclides include noble gases (notably isotopes of krypton and xenon), tritium, and iodine. Advancement and integration of on-line monitoring tools can be particularly beneficial as it can support needs at multiple stages. Examples of integration of probes and sensors that can providein situand real-time characterization of the off-gas line and enable more efficient and informed development and optimization of treatment systems will be given as well as their validation and performance on large flow loops (80L and 160L). Currently, there is a lack of irradiation data for fast-spectrum chloride-fueled MSRs, complicating their licensing. The INL Molten-Salt Research Temperature-controlled Irradiation (MRTI) vehicle is designed to fill this gap by providing critical data on enriched-uranium-bearing salts. Additionally, efforts are underway to develop modeling and simulation capabilities for mechanistic source term analysis, which is essential for reactor licensing.BIO:Dr. Patricia Paviet joined Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in October 2018 where she currently is a Senior Technical Advisor.

    "event_description": "Abstract:Monolayer and few-layer semiconducting Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs), exemplified by materials like MoS2 and WSe2, have garnered increasing interest for next generation electronics such as gate-all-around nanosheet transistors, neuromorphic devices and sensors/imagers heterogeneously integrated with silicon CMOS technology.The interest in semiconducting TMDs arises from their atomically thin nature and passivated van der Waals surfaces, however, realization of high-performance devices requires advances in TMD synthesis to provide wafer-scale films that can be readily integrated into devices via either direct growth or layer transfer methods.Our work has focused on the development of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) as a manufacturing- compatible approach for wafer-scale semiconducting TMDs. The TMDs are grown epitaxially on 2” diameter c-plane sapphire by MOCVD at elevated temperatures (>800 °C) to obtain high crystal quality. Nucleation of TMDs on sapphire is intimately tied to the surface structure and the growth chemistry which can be controlled to achieve unidirectional TMD domains with a significant reduction in mirror twin domains in coalesced films.In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry is demonstrated to be an effective real time monitor of TMD growth even at the sub-monolayer level which can be exploited to track surface coverage as a function of time under varying growth conditions. The ability to precisely control and modulate precursor flux during growth is used to synthesize in-plane heterostructures that enable localized exciton confinement and emission.Applications for wafer-scale TMD monolayers in nanoelectronics, sensing and photonics will be discussed.Bio:Joan Redwing is a Distinguished Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Penn State University.

    "event_description": "Abstract:Similar and dissimilar joining of shape memory alloys (SMAs) has gained increased attention in recent years, due to their use in aerospace, transportation, and biomedical industries. However, traditional joining methods (e.g., fusion welding) are challenging to apply to these materials because they lead to local weakening, formation of brittle intermetallic, and decreases in functional performance.Here, transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding is studied as a viable solution. TLP involves heating a joint to a temperature where interdiffusion produces a lower melting point liquid, which subsequently undergoes isothermal solidification to form a dense joint. TLP is currently used in aerospace for joining similar materials but has proved challenging to extend to dissimilar joining. In this talk, we will discuss how limitations in TLP can be overcome using CALPHAD-based techniques and path planning algorithms to guide phase evolution.We will also describe our ongoing experimental work on similar & dissimilar joints, which include microstructural and mechanical characterization. Although our use case is specific NASA, Houston, Texas to joining SMAs, these approaches are broadly applicable to any dissimilar joining process.Bio:McCue is a tenure-track Assistant Professor and the Morris E.

Further, the degenerate set of 4f electrons confers unique, atomistic electronic- and magnetic-properties to complexes of the elements. In recent years, my research group has been working to expand the capabilities of lanthanide elements through fundamental studies of such complexes and their electronic structures. We have demonstrated that studies of cerium complexes, in terms of electronic structure, properties, and reactivity, are fruitful for discovery of both fundamental aspects of f-element chemistry and new reactivity modalities based on 4f-orbital participation. Recent results will be presented on our studies of organometallic complexes of cerium(IV) and related tetravalent metals showing unique participation of 4f-orbitals in bonding and reactivity, detected by monitoring an unusual single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. We have posited that 4f-orbital engagement can also alter reactivity of lanthanide complexes with properly designed ligand frameworks and reaction manifolds through excited states. Our efforts toward these goals, for the purposes of selective, inter-rare earth reactive separations, will also be discussed.",

In this presentation, the chemical and biocatalytic syntheses of amino acid-derived natural products will be discussed. First, a chemoenzymatic synthesis of 13-oxoverruculogen, an anticancer endoperoxide, is achieved using enzymatic C-H peroxidation and transition metal catalyzed C-C bond activation reactions. Central to the synthesis involves the use of a substrate analog for enzymatic endoperoxidation to accomplish the synthesis of 13-oxoverruculogen. The second part of this presentation describes the chemical synthesis of ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Enteropeptin A is an antimicrobial RiPP natural product with undefined stereochemical configuration at its thioaminoketal stereocenter. The total synthesis of this compound and its congeners resulted in their structural elucidation and the determination of the stereochemical configuration of the enteropeptins.",

    "event_description": "Phase Space Approaches to Electronic Structure: A New Paradigm For Magnetic Field Effects, Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity and Vibrational Circular DichroismThe Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is the cornerstone of chemistry, defining electronic structure relative to fixed nuclear coordinates. It relies on the large mass difference between electrons and nuclei, with nuclei moving much slower and appearing effectively frozen on the time scale of electronic fluctuations. Nevertheless, the BO approximation frequently breaks down, quite famously in photochemistry and/or electron transfer. Less well known is that even when a classical BO theory does not conserve momentum (linear or angular) even when no obvious breakdown occurs. In this talk, I will discuss this failure, introduce phase space approximations as a means to restore conservation, and propose a new paradigm for understanding how nuclear entanglement with electronic degrees of freedom may lead to chiral induced spin selectivity and other magnetic field effects.",

Structural consequences of making these SF5-based “hybrid bioisosteres” and preliminary mechanistic insight will be discussed. Aside from being a topic of fundamental interest, we believe this work affords an unusual and subtle type of flexibility in molecular design that could prove useful in increasing availability of building blocks containing C(sp3)–SF5 and heteroatom–SF5 bonds to medicinal chemists, agrochemists, and in the materials community.",

So far, the limited photostability of individual perovskite QDs remains a challenge for their use in quantum light sources, despite improvements in increasing the binding strength of surface ligands. Here, we show that crystallized, solid-state ligands with strong intermolecular interactions can achieve near-epitaxial passivation and greatly reduce the surface energy of perovskite QDs. Individual CsPbBr3 QDs embedded in molecular crystals demonstrate nearly non-blinking single-photon emission with a purity of 98%. Moreover, these QDs stay stable after 12 hours of continuous operation and continue to show almost non-blinking behavior under saturated excitation levels. The remarkable stability of individual QDs, combined with precise control during synthesis, allows for detailed studies of their structural and optical properties.",

To render high polynomialdegrees efficient, we use matrix-free evaluation of discrete operators.This setup goes against common practice in PDE software design becausethe implementation of finite element components must be integrated intothe linear solvers, rather than outsourcing all linear algebra toexternal packages. I will present the design in the generic librarydeal.II, which requires the application code to only provide animplementation of the operation in quadrature points of cell and faceintegrals. All the integration as well as loop over the mesh can beprovided by the library, including the MPI ghost communication andparallelization strategies.

Amer. Math. Soc.. This amazingly deep paper still contains the most advanced results on the preservation of asymptotic uniform convexity under coarse-Lipschitz embeddings.The topics that will be discussed in the series are:-the preservation under coarse-Lipschitz embeddings of a natural quantitative lower bound on the fundamental function of spreading models generated by weakly null sequences. This result is a consequence of a more general result that establishes a very fine and delicate relationship between certain averages in the Banach space and its modulus of asymptotic midpoint uniform convexity.-understanding conditions under which the weak $p$-co-Banach-Saks property (a sequential property) implies $p$-asymptotic uniform convexity (a tree property). Such a condition relies on the notion of a random $L_p$-norm.-the coarse-Lipschitz rigidity of subspaces and quotients of $\\ell_p$, for $p \\in (1,\\infty)$.-the uniqueness of the coarse (or uniform) structure of $(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\ell_r^n)_{\\ell_p}$ for $1<p<r\\le 2$ or $2\\le r<p<\\infty$.",

    "event_description": "Abstract: Igusa’s local zeta function Z_{f,p}(s) is the generating function that counts the number of integral roots, N_k(f), of f(x_1,…,x_n) mod p^k, for all k. It is a famous result, in analytic number theory, that Z_{f,p} is a rational function in Q(p^s). We give an elementary proof of this fact for a univariate polynomial f(x_1).Our proof, when combined with a fast root-counting algorithm of (Dwivedi, Mittal, Saxena, CCC, 2019), yields the *first* poly(|f|, log p) time algorithm to compute Z_{f,p}(s). We leave the same question for n=2 open.The talk is based on the joint work with Ashish Dwivedi, published in “14th Biannual Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium”, ANTS-XIV <https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/%7Esgal018/ANTS/>, 2020. Additionally, I will motivate the earlier methods, the follow-up results, and state the major open questions, in the polynomial arithmetic modulo prime-powers.",

It was proved by Shimura that if f has algebraic Fourier coefficients, then there is a non-zero complex number w so that the ratio f(z)/w^k is an algebraic number. Moreover, w is a non-zero period of a CM elliptic curve defined over a number field whose endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to Q(z). In this talk, we will present an analogue of Shimura’s result for Drinfeld modular forms of arbitrary rank. This generalizes the prior results established by Chang in the rank 2 setting.

His research won awards from the Midwest Sociological Society, American Sociological Association, Academy of Management, and the American Society of Criminology.AbstractThe purpose of this research is to understand the relationship between dimensions of the social structure and greenhouse gas emissions in U.S. fossil fueled electrical power plants. While environmental scholars have made important contributions to understanding society-environmental relations, theoretical growth and therefore the capacity to affect environmental policy is hampered by the lack of integration among different middle range perspectives. To address this issue, we adopt Robert Merton’s observation that theoretical advances require the ‘consolidation of groups of special [middle range] theories.’ We develop a conceptual framework and conduct an empirical analysis that includes core dimensions of the component parts of the social structure. We present graphs with predicted values from our regression model to illustrate the expected gas emissions, based on values of key independent variables, making complex statistical results more interpretable and meaningful.Zoom LinkRSVP Link",

This geographic heterogeneity could be consequential for Latinx children’s health care access, with prior research suggesting increased health access barriers for Latinx children in new versus established areas of settlement. Merging public-use county-level data with restricted individual-level health data from the National Health Interview Survey (2010–2014), we quantitatively examine how three health access indicators—health insurance coverage, delayed care, and usual place of care—differ among children (ages 4–17) in Latinx immigrant, Latinx U.S.-born, White U.S.-born, and Black U.S.-born families (n=89,994) across established, fast-growing hub, new, and minor Latinx destination counties. We also examine the potential roles of local immigrant hostilities and health care resources in contributing to health access differences across destinations. In fully adjusted models, children in new destinations are less likely to have health insurance than peers in established destinations, and this disparity is even wider for Latinx children of immigrants. Adjusted model results also show that children in new destinations are more likely to have delayed care than those in established destinations, and children in these four groups in new destinations, fast-growing hubs, and minor destinations are more likely to have no usual place of care than peers in established destinations. Our results are consistent with prior work suggesting that more health care access barriers exist for children, particularly Latinx children of immigrants, in new versus established Latinx destinations.BioDr. Potochnick’s research examines the social demography of immigration and how programs and policies can promote the education and health of immigrant youth. She uses an interdisciplinary perceptive to identify the health and educational needs and resources of immigrant children and families, and to examine the impact national, state, and local-level policies have on their well-being. Current projects examine how federal immigration raids and local-level immigration enforcement policies affect the mental health and school investment decisions of immigrant children at different times in their educational pathway, how pre-migration schooling and parental resources affect children’s post-migration mobility, and how settlement in new immigrant growth areas affects the health of immigrant children.",

    "event_description": "Statistical methods for detecting spatially regulated genes in spatial transcriptomicsSpatial transcriptomics (ST) comprises a suite of genomic technologies enabling the profiling of gene expression on tissues with spatial localization information, offering critical insights into how cellular context and the local environment shape transcriptional programs. However, most current methods lack the ability to detect cell-type-specific spatial patterns or model interactions between cell types and their microenvironment. In this talk, I’ll first introduce CELINA, a statistical method for systematically detecting cell type-specific SVGs (ct-SVGs), a subset of SVGs exhibiting distinct spatial expression patterns within specific cell types. Celina utilizes a spatially varying coefficient model to accurately capture each gene’s spatial expression pattern in relation to the distribution of cell types across tissue locations, ensuring effective type I error control and high power. CELINA reveals fine-scale heterogeneity within cell types, providing a clearer view of localized expression changes that is often missed by global analyses. If time allows, I’ll also introduce CYGNET, which detects differentially expressed genes whose expression is modulated by interactions between specific cell types and their local microenvironmental exposures. By explicitly modeling these interactions, CYGNET enhances interpretability and reveals disease mechanisms underlying immune regulation, tumor-stroma crosstalk, and neuroinflammation. Together, CELINA and CYGNET address key limitations in current spatial transcriptomic data analyses, providing a deeper understanding of the spatial gene regulatory mechanisms underlying disease progression and tissue function.",

    "event_description": "Leveraging Causal Inference and Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Personalized Dynamic Treatment RegimesIn this talk, we will present recent advancements in statistical causal learning for evaluating Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs), which allow treatments to be tailored dynamically based on evolving, subject-level data. Identifying an optimal DTR is crucial for advancing precision medicine and personalized healthcare. We first introduce a Tree-based doubly robust Reinforcement Learning (T-RL) method, which builds decision trees while retaining the strengths of batch-mode reinforcement learning. We then present a Stochastic-Tree search method, ST-RL, for evaluating optimal DTRs. ST-RL stands out in the literature due to its non-greedy policy search, and demonstrates superior performance even when handling datasets with a large number of covariates. Furthermore, we address a common challenge in real-world applications: practical constraints or “restrictions” on treatment decisions. To overcome this, we extend to a Restricted Tree-based Reinforcement Learning (RT-RL) method, which incorporates these restrictions into the learning process. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods using an observational dataset to estimate a two-stage stepped-up DTR for guiding care placement decisions for adolescents with substance use disorders. Through these developments, we aim to showcase how causal learning and reinforcement learning can significantly improve the design of personalized, adaptive treatment strategies in healthcare.",

Despite the importance of crucial conversations, we often avoid them because we’re afraid we’ll make matters worse. Mishandled conversations have a huge impact. In fact, they’re at the root of most persistent problems in organizations, teams, and relationships. At the heart of healthy and high-performance organizations are people willing and able to hold crucial conversations.Backed by 30 years of social science, “crucial conversations” skills represent the standard in effective communication and the marker of high-performance individuals and organizations. This course will teach you how to engage in those difficult or high-stakes crucial conversations.This course is designed to:Identify the elements of a crucial conversationDemonstrate and prepare to handle crucial conversations effectivelyRegister via TrainTraq byOctober 23rd.",

With the Soviet Union collapsing and the Cold War ending, and the Berlin Wall crumbling and Germany preparing to reunify, President Bush was uniquely positioned to fashion a new world strategy for international politics and cooperation. The conflict between Iraq and Kuwait, along with the subsequent invasion, gave President Bush an opportunity to test his leadership and his vision for international collaboration and democratization.In his book, The Gulf War: George H.W. Bush and American Grand Strategy in the Post-Cold War Era (2024), Spencer Bakish discusses President Bush’s transformational politics during Desert Shield/Desert Storm.Spencer Bakich is a Professor of International Studies and the Director of the National Security Program at the Virginia Military Institute, and a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. His scholarly work includes authoring and editing three books, providing commentary to major publications and interviewing senior policymakers, military officers and Foreign Service officers who served with George H.W. Bush.This event is being held as a part of our 35 Anniversary of Desert Shield/Desert Storm series, where we will explore various aspects of the conflict throughout the fall of 2025 and the spring of 2026.Join us on Thursday, October 16, as Spencer Bakich discusses President Bush’s transformational international politics during Desert Shield/Desert Storm.

    "event_description": "Traditional borehole geophysical measurements (e.g., LWD or wireline measurements) have a very shallow range of spatial sensitivity around the well trajectory (shorter than 1-6 ft), hence are limited in their ability to image and/or anticipate reservoir-size features that are critical for well geosteering, and optimal reservoir engineering and in-flow performance. Ultra-Deep Azimuthal Resistivity (UDAR) measurements are relatively new commercial geophysical measurements which provide advanced borehole imaging capabilities (anywhere between 10-150 ft away from the well trajectory) by bridging the gap between well logging and seismic interpretation. However, interpreting UDAR measurements in complex, spatially heterogeneous, or anisotropic formations remains challenging. Traditional 2D and 3D inversion (imaging) procedures are computationally intensive, therefore unsuitable for real-time well geosteering applications.We describe our recent progress in the development of fast modeling and inversion algorithms for UDAR measurements. These algorithms are designed for multi-CPU clusters and tailored for integration with local 3D geological models and arbitrary well trajectories. Modeling employs a finite-volume solution of Maxwell’s equations implemented on an adaptive Lebedev grid, effectively accounting for diverse formation complexities and tool configurations. A new block-based solver computes multi-input multi-output (MIMO) responses efficiently, significantly reducing CPU runtime. Inversion is performed with both gradient-based (Occam-type) and stochastic approaches and incorporates regularization to account for measurement noise and non-uniqueness in the estimation.Our inversion-based interpretation method is successfully validated with challenging synthetic and field UDAR measurements acquired in the North Sea by various service companies. It is confirmed that the modeling and inversion algorithms are efficient, stable, and reliable for estimating geologically-plausible spatial distributions of anisotropic electrical conductivity around and ahead of the well trajectory.",

I would discuss the great importance of squeezed states in quantum metrology. These saturate quantum Cramer- Rao bounds in the estimation of a large number of parameters of interest. Thus, squeezed states produce Heisenberg limited sensing of parameters [1] like force fields; interferometric quantities like phases which enable one to extract quantities like concentration. I will then demonstrate how QCRB or Heisenberg limited sensing can be realized via standard quantum optical measurement of the error sensitivity in SU(1,1) interferometry. Remarkably enough these ideas are equally applicable to quantum networks [2] and open systems [3]._________________________Tutorial per invitation by Prof. Marlan Scully[1] G. S. Agarwal, and L.

These cosmic explosions are responsible for synthesizing and dispersing heavy elements, enriching galaxies with the building blocks necessary for planet formation and life itself. Supernovae inject vast amounts of energy into their surrounding environments, influencing star formation and galactic evolution. Understanding these events is key to unraveling the chemical history of the universe and the cycle of stellar life and death. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these core collapse supernovae are not well understood. I will discuss how we probe these explosions and their complex environments using polarized light. I will discuss the current state of the field of spectropolarimetry, along with the state-of-the-art modeling efforts used to interpret observed polarimetric data.",

Strikingly, this background can be highly anisotropic on large scales, directly reflecting axion fluctuations and offering a new observable beyond the CMB and large-scale structure, which trace adiabatic inflaton perturbations. I will discuss the dynamics of axion rotation, the resulting gravitational-wave signal and its anisotropy, and the prospects for probing this distinctive signature with future detectors.",

    "event_description": "There is now experimental evidence that a material can be both crystalline and superfluid, a seemingly impossible combination that has been studied theoretically for over fifty years, and quite recently experimentally. We first briefly review superfluidity, dating from the 1930’s and responsible for numerous Nobel Prizes. In 1969 Andreev and Lifshitz argued that the superfluidity of a solid is based on defect motion, proposed that such systems can have both superfluid and normal fluid components, and developed a dynamical theory for such a system. In 1970 Leggett argued that such a system has an overall quantum-mechanical phase whose gradient defines a superfluid velocity, and leads to a non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI). For a brief time around 2004 it was thought that solid 4He displays NCRI, but additional measurements showed that the observed effect was due to defects. However, in 2023 experiments on BEC dilute atomic solids revealed extra scattering spots when such a solid is rotated, which was interpreted as vortex line formation associated with superfluidity. Taking Leggett’s phase-flow viewpoint, we argue that at temperature T=0 a crystalline superfluid will have a superfluid fraction less than one, and thus missing mass. We resolve this by attributing a mass-bearing velocity to the solid. At finite T this system will have excitations and therefore a normal fluid velocity. Thus we consider that a supersolid has three mass-bearing velocities, each with its own velocity and response. We develop the dynamical theory of this system and discuss its expected experimental properties.",

    "event_description": "There are several methods of handling the highly nonlinear system of the Einstein field equations in order to derive the exact solutions or to extract the salient features of the corresponding spacetime dynamics. One such approach is the semi-tetrad covariant formalism of gravity. The semi-tetrad methods are the 1 + 3 covariant approach developed by Ehlers in 1961 and Ellis in 1971, and the 1 + 1 + 2 covariant approach developed by Clarkson and Barrett in 2003. The 1+3 formalism has generated new results in gauge-invariant study and specific spacetimes, among others. An extension of the 1+3 covariant approach is the 1+1+2 covariant approach, which has generated new results in locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes in General Relativity, and also illustrated other important features of gravitational dynamics, including gravitational collapse. I will offer a brief exposition to these two formalisms and discuss a few applications with particular reference to the 1 + 1 + 2 approach.",

We focus on two prototypical examples to illustrate this idea: the statistical Ising model on the lattice and large N ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. For the latter, we discuss bootstrap results for both one-point and two-point correlators.",

We use projected stream morphologies to constrain the shape and barycenter of each host galaxy’s potential, jointly probing baryonic and dark matter distributions. These inferences complement lensing, with sensitivity to halo geometry on tens of kpc scales. The method enables both stacked, population-level constraints on halo triaxiality and barycenters, and individual-halo inference on the same. Already, we find promising agreement with ΛCDM predictions. Our program will identify thousands of streams, enabling precise constraints on halo shapes and barycenters across large samples and redshifts, offering a new dynamical test of dark structures.",

A wide range of research projects that examine the salience of race and ethnicity are of interest to RESI, however, proposals connecting to theRESI HSI Research Initiativeportfolio areparticularly encouraged. Texas A&M University is amongst the largest and most well resourced (in terms of total annual research expenditures) Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the country. RESI is strongly committed to building our university’s profile in HSI-related research. To best focus our research investment, we expect that somewhere between half and two-thirds of grants made will be channeled into the HSI Research Initiative portfolio.",

In the present talk, I present theKnowledge Production Pipeline (KPP) as a framework that serves to break down the scientific process into components to highlight how knowledge production can be (in) equitable. I also present recent findings of a mixed-methods study investigating scholars’ experiences of bias and inequality in the peer-review process, highlighting four distinct approaches to peer-review that contribute to issues in equity and quality in science production. I conclude with suggestions for teaching and implementing practices that contribute to a more equitable science.",

    "event_title": "CDE - Bone Preservation Strategies Following Severe Traumatic Dental Injuries in Children",
    "event_summary": "Course SummarySevere traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) in young patients can result in unrestorable teeth or replacement resorption and ankylosis with the potential for infra-occlusion in growing children. Extraction is often the treatment rendered in these cases. When permanent teeth are subsequently extracted, long-term complications are likely. The supporting bone will be lost, creating the need for additional interventions later in life when the patient is ready for a more permanent option to rehabilitate the area. In the meantime, young, growing patients have limited prosthetic options if a tooth is lost. Bone preservation in young patients is of paramount importance. When patients are ready for definitive tooth replacement (eg. implant), previous bone preservation can make the process simpler and less costly as the need for bone and soft tissue augmentation may be minimal or unnecessary. This presentation will cover a series of clinical cases where bone preservation strategies were employed when treating young patients following severe TDIs. This presentation will emphasize how a multidisciplinary approach is paramount to achieve optimal results, where the endodontist needs to collaborate with periodontists, oral surgeons, orthodontists and general dentists.REGISTER:https://reg.learningstream.com/reg/event_page.aspx?ek=0069-0031-d1f4b6742b994ee897de8e0a2b173643",

This program allows residents to have their private well water screened, as well as provide education training for groundwater protection. This event is hosted by the Bluebonnet Groundwater Conservation District, the Grimes County AgriLife Extension office and the Walker County AgriLife Extension office. It is open to the public and free to attend, lunch will be provided.Joel Pigg,Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Serviceprogram specialist, College Station, said the Texas Well Owner Network program is for Texas residents who depend on household wells for their water needs.“The TWON program was established to help well owners become familiar with Texas groundwater resources, septic system maintenance, well maintenance and construction, and water quality and treatment,” he said.Water samples will be screened for contaminants, including total coliform bacteria, E. coli bacteria, nitrate-nitrogen and salinity.Sampling instructionsPlease use a new bottle of water (12-20 ounces), pour out the contents and fill it with a water sample from your private water well. Take the sample from the spigot/hose bib nearest to the well head. Remove the water hose if there is one and take directly from the spigot/hose bib. If an inside faucet is used, you will need to remove the aerator on faucet before making the collection. Rinse and dry the exterior of the faucet to prevent exterior contamination of your water sample. If possible, wipe off with a Clorox-type towelette or paper towel wetted with a light bleach solution to kill any bacteria present on the faucet.Allow the solution to dry before sampling.Turn on the water full force and let it run at full force for two minutes or until you hear the pump start running. Reduce the water flow to a small stream and collect the sample.Refrigerate the sample and transport it to the workshop (in an ice chest) as soon after collection as possible. It is best to collect the day of the workshop if possible ;otherwise make sure the sample is kept cool and out of direct sunlight. Sample should be collected within 24 hours before the workshop to ensure accurate results.We encourage you to bring samples from all wells on your property; many participants that have water treatment equipment take samples before and after treatment to make sure the equipment is functioning properly. We need for you to label the sample with your name (if you bring more than one sample you also need to label the sample in a way to make sure you know which well the sample comes from). We will be screening for Nitrates, TDS (salinity) and bacteria (absence or presence of coliform and E. coli) with your sample.There will be a $15 per sample charge for this water well screening and you may bring as many samples as you would like.Pigg said it is essential for those submitting samples to be at the follow-up meeting to receive results, learn corrective measures for identified problems and improve their understanding of private well management.Water contaminants concernsPigg said research shows the presence ofE. colibacteria in water indicates that waste from humans or warm-blooded animals may have contaminated the water. Water contaminated withE. coliis more likely to also have pathogens that can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea or other symptoms.The presence of nitrate-nitrogen in well water is also a concern, and water with nitrate-nitrogen at levels of 10 parts per million is considered unsafe for human consumption, he said.“These nitrate levels above 10 parts per million can disrupt the ability of blood to carry oxygen throughout the body, resulting in a condition called methemoglobinemia,” Pigg said. “Infants less than 6 months of age are the most susceptible to this.”Salinity, as measured by total dissolved solids, will also be determined for each sample, he said. Water with high levels may leave deposits and have a salty taste. Using water with high levels for irrigation may damage soil or plants.To learn more about the program or to find additional publications and resources, visittwon.tamu.edu. For more information on the water screening contact Pigg at 979-321-5946 orj-pigg@tamu.edu.The screenings are presented by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension andTexas Water Resources Institute, TWRI.Funding for TWON are through a Clean Water Act Section 319(h) nonpoint source grant provided by theTexas State Soil and Water Conservation Boardand theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The project is managed by TWRI, part ofTexas A&M AgriLife Research, AgriLife Extension and theTexas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.For more information specific to the workshop, contact the Grimes County AgriLife Extension office at 936-873-3907, Walker County AgriLife Extension Office at 936-435-2426, or the Bluebonnet Groundwater Conservation District at 936-825-7303 or Joel Pigg atj-pigg@tamu.eduor 979-321-5946.",

Unlike older models that read words one at a time, transformers look at an entire sentence (or even a whole paragraph) at once, figuring out how each word relates to the others. This “attention” trick allows large language models (LLMs) to generate smooth, meaningful text, translate languages, and even hold conversations that feel natural. In this talk, we’ll break down the magic behind transformers using simple examples, explore how models learn from huge amounts of data, and play with the “settings” that shape their personality—like temperature (how creative the AI sounds) and top-k (how many word options it considers). By the end, you’ll understand not only how these models work, but also why they’re changing the way we study, work, and create.",

    "event_description": "More students are arriving on campus with experiences of trauma that shape how they learn, engage, and seek support. Academic advisors are often among the first professionals to build trust. This webinar will introduce foundational principles of trauma-informed advising, equipping you with practical strategies to recognize signs of trauma, respond with empathy, and help students connect to resources if needed. Presenters Kaiti Blackburn (Jana's Campaign) and Shantalea Johns (Wayne State University) will draw on research and their lived experiences to discuss how trauma can impact a student's brain, behavior, motivation, and academic performance. You'll learn how to create safer advising spaces, support students through challenges, and make intentional choices that foster dignity and belonging, without overstepping your role or taking on more than is sustainable.",

    "event_description": "The process of training as a new advisor can often be a trial by fire. Advising offices can create practices and resources that give structure and support to the learning process for new advisors, and NACADA’s Core Competencies and New Advisor Development Chart provide a map of what should be learned. Yet the process of creating comprehensive training and development programs from the ground up can feel daunting (if not impossible). This webinar’s hosts will share their experiences creating structures to support new advisor learning and break down their developments into manageable steps for implementation. We will help you dream big in design and think small in implementation to see your interventions compound changes over time (and will include a few helpful resources to get started with those small changes).",

As advisors, most of us entered this helping profession with exactly that in mind-the hope that we can cheerlead alongside our students to help them to build the pathways and successes to support their greatest goals. In this episode, listeners will 'ride along through the neighborhood' and learn about Fred Rogers' theory of personal development and its applications to academic advising. We will examine the 'just one person' model and its potential influences for specialized and underrecognized populations of students, including refugee students. Second, we will apply Mr. Roger's four 'simple interactions approach,' which includes the basic interaction strategies of creating connection, inclusion, reciprocity, and opportunity for growth. Finally, we will explore how adviso",
